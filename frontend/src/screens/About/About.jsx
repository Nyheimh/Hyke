              Hyke was derived from the passion of hiking. The ability to be
              apart of nature and without the use of technology allows my mind
              to relax and learn more about myself and surroundings. Nature is
              essential and allows one to be relieved from the everyday life
              that we are accustomed to. Join me in going on hikes when the
              weather is beautiful and enjoy the time away from the daily life.{" "}
